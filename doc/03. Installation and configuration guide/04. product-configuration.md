- **License key:** A pre-purchased license key for the **"PUQ PowerDNS"** module. For the module to work correctly, the key must be active
- **Max Zones:** The number of zones that will be available for the client to manage.
- **Edit SOA:** Whether to allow the client to manage the SOA record.
- **Zone name filter:** In this field, you can enter regular expressions to filter zone names that the client can add. Each filter should be on a separate line, and each filter is checked in sequence, meaning the zone will not be added if even one filter matches.
- **Nameservers:** In this section, enter the name servers that will be added to the zone (Your DNS cluster).
- **SOA:** In this section, enter all the SOA record parameters that will be used by default.

### Zone template

Here are the rules for creating DNS records. These records will be automatically generated when a zone is created. Placeholders like `{zone}` will be replaced with the actual zone name. The format for defining records is as follows:

**Format:**  
`name type ttl content`

### Explanation:

1. **name**:
    - This specifies the name of the subdomain or record.
    - For example, `ftp` will expand to `ftp.<zone.name>`.
    - Use `@` to refer to the main zone (root domain).
2. **type**:
    - The type of DNS record.
    - Examples include: `A`, `AAAA`, `MX`, `CNAME`, `TXT`, `SRV`, `CAA`, `DNSKEY`, `DS`, `NAPTR`, `TLSA`.
3. **ttl (Time To Live)**:
    - The duration (in seconds) for which the record is cached by DNS resolvers.
    - Recommended default is `3600` seconds (1 hour).
4. **content**:
    - The value or data for the record, provided without abbreviations or placeholders.
    - For example, for an `A` record, this would be the IPv4 address.

These rules ensure consistency and accuracy when defining DNS records for your zones.  

### **Example Zone Records Template**

**A Records (IPv4):**

```
@           A       3600    192.168.1.1
@           A       3600    192.168.1.3
www         A       3600    192.168.1.2
www2        A       3600    192.168.1.3
```

**AAAA Records (IPv6):**

```
@           AAAA    3600    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
@           AAAA    3600    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7336
www         AAAA    3600    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7335
www2        AAAA    3600    2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7335
```

**CNAME Records (Aliases):**

```
ftp         CNAME   3600    {zone}
ftp2        CNAME   3600    example.com
```

**MX Records (Mail Exchange):**

```
@           MX      3600    10 mail.{zone}
@           MX      3600    20 backupmail.{zone}
```

**TXT Records (Text Data):**

```
@           TXT     3600    v=spf1 ip4:192.168.1.1 -all
@           TXT     3600    SOME TXT TEXT
_dmarc      TXT     3600    v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@{zone}
```

**CAA Records (Certification Authority Authorization):**

```
@           CAA     3600    0 issue      letsencrypt.org
@           CAA     3600    0 issuewild  comodoca.com
@           CAA     3600    0 iodef      mailto:admin@{zone}
```

**NAPTR Record (Naming Authority Pointer):**

```
_sip._udp   NAPTR   3600    100 10 S SIP+D2U * sip.{zone}.
```

**SRV Records (Service Locator):**

```
_sip._tcp   SRV     3600    10 5 5060 sipserver.{zone}
```

### **Key Notes:**

- **`@`**: Represents the main zone (e.g., the root domain).
- **Placeholders like `{zone}`**: Will be replaced by the actual zone name during execution.
- **TTL (Time to Live)**: Use 3600 seconds by default, which is standard for DNS records.
- Adjust records based on your specific zone requirements. These templates cover common DNS record types for a functional zone configuration.
